# About this course

Hi and welcome, I am **[Felix Zajitschek](https://felix.zajitschek.net), an evolutionary biologist, working on topics such as aging and life-history that require to analyse or incorporate lifespan**. This course is meant mainly as a primer for students who would like to know more about various methods which can be used to accomplish this. It will give you an overview of what can be done, how to perform a number of specific analyses, and where to go when you need to analyse more complex data.. 

All the actual statistical analyses are performed in the [software R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), and you will have the opportunity to run R software scripts right here, on this website, without the need to install software on your computer.

![](https://github.com/zajitschek/lifespananalysis/blob/master/images/pushpin.svg?raw=true) Please note, if you plan on actually doing a meta-analysis yourself, beyond just going through this exercise, you will have to download R or [R studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), if you haven't already. 

# How to use this resource

We will see why lifespan is a very important biological characteristic, explain what different measures of lifespan (such as average lifespan, survival, mortality, etc.) there are and why, and then go through worked examples.

You will also have the opportunity to perform steps directly in R, without having to open it locally. This will look like this grey block below. Just click on the "Run Code" button and see what happens. 
(You may need some patience - a couple of minutes - when you run the first  code block. This is because the R environment has to be loaded. Sometimes it may fail to connect the first time when you click RUN, so just re-run).

<codeblock id="intro_1">
Write your name where the dotted line is!
</codeblock>

You can also use the "Show hints", "Show solution" and "Reset" tabs. Don't worry about doing in anything "wrong" - you will not be breaking these code blocks! You can also use these blocks to calculate whatever else you think of - try for example writing "1+1", and run it again! (For advanced R users - you can't import your own datasets, but of course could add them manually!)

Each section may contain links, such as this [link to google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), questions to answer (including feedback on getting it right or wrong), and tasks to do on your own - as indicated by this laptop icon  ![](https://github.com/zajitschek/lifespananalysis/blob/master/images/computertaskicon.svg?raw=true). If I think a note or resource is particularly useful, you will see this pushpin  ![](https://github.com/zajitschek/lifespananalysis/blob/master/images/pushpin.svg?raw=true).
<br>

Please note, this is meant as a quick primer to give you some overview of how lifespan can be analysed. If you're working on analyses for a publication, we highly recommend to check out some of the additional resources that are out there. Our resource here is only a starting point, and also does not cover the full range of R packages that are available for lifespan- and survival analyses.

For a small collection of freely available resources (that may be using other R packages) please see Chapter 5.

# Why is lifespan important in biology?   


## A short side-trip to the roots of knowledge

Humans strive to understand the world. The organized framework to do this is science, more specifically the *[scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)*. Science is cumulative in nature. This means that studies and experiments build upon the findings of previous studies and experiments. New scientific insights might be gained by a more or less progressive accumulation of knowledge about a specific question, adding on to existing knowledge. Or, according to [Thomas Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn), real progression in science might require [paradigm shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) that throw old theories over board and make way for new better theories. These shifts in how we explain the world depend themselves on the accumulation of results, which did not fit the old established theories, but which turned out to be not due to error of any kind (for example methodological mistakes or human error in performing studies).

## What makes a successful scientific theory?

We are talking about empirical research here, meaning results from studies and experiments that are based on observations. But what is the criterion that scientists use to accept a scientific theory as the currently most successful theory to explain observed phenomena?

- A successful scientific theory should give a good explanation and make accurate predictions
- This should be the case in a wide range of circumstances, i.e. it shouldn't be hyper-sensitive to natural variation in traits that are not the direct focus of the studies

Different scientific disciplines will have different criteria for how we define *good explanation*, *accurate prediction*, *sensitive*, and *natural variation* that I used above.
This self-guided course is mainly focussed on research in biological sciences. My own research involves the study of animal behaviour, which often has a high level of noise in the data, especially when compared to some studies in physics or geology (if interested, read up on the colloquial terms of soft and hard sciences, e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science)). 

# Meta-analysis can help

We established that science works cumulatively. To gain support for specific hypothesis, we do not want to rely on the outcome of single studies. We can try to combine the knowledge gained in multiple studies which tested specific traits of interest. This can be achieved while still taking into account that studies differ in their quality and their size, for example, lending different levels of weights to their results. 

This combination of multiple test results can be achieved by qualitatively summarising previous work on a specific subject. Classically, this was done in a literature review, for example at the beginning of a graduate or postgraduate degree. While this type of review has still its merit (especially if it is done ***systematically***), we want to introduce you here to the meta-analytical approach (which strictly speaking is a **quantitative systematic review**), which can provide a quantitative summary and test of specific research questions (the Greek prefix *meta* (μετά, "after" or "beyond") means *more comprehensive*).

# Overview

This is meant as a first step to get you started.  Here's an overview of the workflow:

![](https://github.com/SusZaj/metaanalysis/blob/master/images/overview2.png?raw=true)
<br>
<br>
As just mentioned, all of these steps have to be described and laid out in a protocol. 

Protocols are necessary to minimize any bias that we might introduce - either knowingly, but most often unknowingly - into the decisions that have to be taken at each meta-analysis step. Bias might already be present in how the research question we want to tackle is phrased. Furthermore, bias can originate in the specific way we search for literature, both in where we search (for example, which databases we use, or whether we only include published results), and how we search (for example our choice of search terms).

The following diagram (Figure 1 from Nakagawa et al. 2017)](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0357-7) shows a more in depth overview over steps and quality control that are part of a well-conducted meta-analysis. The questions on the right hand side need to be answered in your final product to provide reproducibility, the flow chart on the left details the methods and options that have to be considered for each step.

## Some examples 
If you haven't looked at many meta-analyses yet, you can have a glance and see what questions were asked and how the results are presented in the examples below. Especially the first in the list (Macartney et al. 2019) is a very good example, with protocols, data, and R code published and made freely available (see *Data & R Code* below). In fact, we'll use a subset of their data in our guided example in the data analysis parts in Chapter 3:
