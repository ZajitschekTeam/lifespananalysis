<exercise id="1" title="Links for Meta-Analysis">

**[If you work on / have published on meta analyses and think your work should be included here, please get in touch!]**

## Other online resources / courses / tutorials on meta-analyses 
All of the freely available resources listed here provide much more detail, specifically on the stats, than what has been provided in this course. Please note, there are many more (print and online) resources on Meta-analysis available, but I have decided to here only provide links to freely accessible resources. You may notice that the focus quickly shifts away from biology, more towards psychology / social sciences, as these are highly active fields of research utilizing meta-analysis, and hence have developed great resources:

- Shinichi's short workshops on the "Environmental Computing" site, [Meta analysis 1](http://environmentalcomputing.net/meta-analysis-1/), [2](http://environmentalcomputing.net/meta-analysis-2/) and [3](http://environmentalcomputing.net/meta-analysis-3/)

- Background on [OpenMEE](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12708)    

- Balduzzi, Rücker  & Schwarzer (2019): [How to perform a meta-analysis with R: a practical tutorial](https://ebmh.bmj.com/content/22/4/153.long)
  
- Basu's preprint tutorial on [PeerJ 2017](https://peerj.com/preprints/2978v1/)
  
- Thomas Pollet's [online course](https://tvpollet.github.io/Meta-analysis_course)
  
- A full online book by Mathias Harrer et al.: [Doing Meta-Analysis in R: A Hands-on Guide](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/)

- Pim Cuijper's video course on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-h5cI5Bkvt0J-O0kq_9J9_aksWFPgR7s) (also available as free book, downloadable [here](https://indd.adobe.com/view/5fc8f9a0-bf1e-49d3-bf5f-a40bfe5409e0) )
  
- Stephanie Kovalchik's [2013 tutorial](http://edii.uclm.es/~useR-2013/Tutorials/kovalchik/kovalchik_meta_tutorial.pdf)


## Building phylogenies

While not covered here at all, it is quite likely that as biologist one finds him- or herself in the situation of having to deal with a wide range of species. While using some taxonomic descriptor (such as genus) is the easy workaround, it may be more appropriate to actually include a phylogenetic tree as random factor in your meta-analytic model, especially if your questions spans across a wide range of species. 

[This blog here outlines a range of different methods, using olive oil microbes as example....](https://taylorreiter.github.io/2017-07-28-Taxonomy-from-Species-Name-in-R/)
