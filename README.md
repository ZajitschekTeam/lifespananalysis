# Lifespan-analysis for Biologists - an online starter course in R

### Hello and welcome! 
This repository contains the resources for my starter course on lifespan-analysis, 
**Lifespan-analysis for Biologists**, which can be found and used here: 
<http://lifespananalysis.zajitschek.net/>
The site was co-developed with Susi Zajitschek (LJMU).
The technical side of this site was developed and made available by <a href='https://ines.io/'>Ines Montani</a>, who created her course [spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io) and made it publicly available, including step-by-step instructions of how to adapt and host the course (https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r). Thanks for that, Ines!
